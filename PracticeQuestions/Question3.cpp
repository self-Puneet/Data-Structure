// Student Grades Storage: A teacher wants to keep track of grades for a class of 30 students. Implement a system using arrays to input student names and their grades. The program should allow the teacher to calculate and display the average grade and identify the highest and lowest grades in the class.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class StudentRecord {
    private:
        double grade;
        string name;

    public: 
        
}

class GradesStorage {
    
    public:
        StudentRecord students[30] = {};


}
